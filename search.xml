<li><p>What is the most challenging part of academic research? (科研中最有挑战性的是什么？)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think deciding a topic is the most challenging. Sometimes the supervisor or senior students in the lab will give us a specific topic, that’s good, but most of the time, we should decide a topic by ourselves. There are so many things to think about. How difficult is this topic? Has anyone done this before? What is the practical significance of this project? Would this topic work? All of these need to be carefully considered and verified.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>How to start a new subject that you have never known about before? (如何上手一个你从未接触过的新项目？)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firstly, I will assess what knowledge is involved in the topic.</p>
<p>Second, if there are any aspects of knowledge that I’m not familiar to, I will search for the reviews of those areas.</p>
<p>Then, summarize the knowledge and information obtained from the investigation, and design the model and method of this research.</p>
<p>And the following is experimental validation and the paper writing.</p>

<li><p>Why do you think you are the right candidate for this Ph.D. program? (你为什么认为你是这个博士项目的合适人选？)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, I have rich academic research experience during my undergraduate study, which exercises my academic research accomplishment. Second, I have a solid professional foundation. What’s more, I’m optimistic and tenacious, and those are exactly what a researcher should have. And, I have a strong interest in the major I’m applying for, which will be my motivation to explore the unknown in the future. </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Why do you wish to pursue a doctoral degree? (你为什么要攻读博士学位？)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In terms of my interest, I’m interested in AI, which field I want my future career to be in. To be a researcher, or to be an engineer that can witness the cutting-edge technology in this field. I didn’t have systematic courses about this field during my undergraduate years and my cognition in this field is still relatively shallow. A doctoral degree will give me a chance to go deeper into this field.</p>
<p>And in terms of my ambition, I want to be a person who can make a great contribution to the society, and a doctoral degree will give me the opportunity to improve myself and qualify me to be such a person.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>What do you plan to do after you have completed your Ph.D.? （你获得博士学位后有什么计划？）</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel my doctoral project can open up new lines of research for this field and want to sue it as  the foundation for a fruitful research career.</p>
<p>I hope to work as a researcher in some large technology companies such as Baidu, Tencent. They have very competitive environments, surrounded by highly skilled people. In this environment, I can continue to make progress and explore the most cutting-edge technology in this field.</p>
<p>But, I’m also interested in the wider development opportunities included in this doctoral programme. I want to be a researcher, but I’m happy to keep other options open.</p>

<li><p>Why are you interested in computer vision? （你为什么会对计算机视觉感兴趣？)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, computer vision is one of the hottest fields in the area of AI, most innovative methods come from here. It’s interesting and challenging.</p>
<p>Second, my past academic research experience is all about AI in life science. The problems are somehow abstract. When I finished an experiment, I could only see the scores of performance evaluation metrics. I couldn’t see the things I was researching. The tasks in computer vision are relatively straightforward, I can feel what I’m doing directly with my eyes.</p>
<p>What’s more, in the daily life, I also pay attention to some social media related to artificial intelligence, I saw many cool computer vision algorithms on them. Such as “Everybody dance now”, which can copy the dance to another people. Most of them looks very interesting.</p>

<li><p>Why do you choose Westlake University? (你为什么会选择西湖大学？)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was preparing for the postgraduate entrance examination, but when I learned about Westlake University in detail, I realized that Westlake University is a better choice.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, firstly, the academic level of the teachers here is very high, which is the most important. secondly, the living conditions here are very good, very attractive. There is another important point is that Westlake University provides me a larger chance to pursue what I’m interested in. </p>
<p>These are the reasons why I choose Westlake University.</p>

<p>First, strong learning ability.</p>
<p>Second, I’m composed</p>
<p>Third, good at cooperation</p>

</li>
<li><p>What weaknesses do you see in yourself? (你觉得你有什么缺点？)</p>

<p>First, lack of urgency.</p>
<p>Second, I’m a little inarticulate.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>What are your strengths and weaknesses? (优点和缺点一起)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I have a strong ability to learn now knowledge. When I meet a new project, I can always quickly learn the required pre-knowledge and get started with the work. But I’m not good at summarizing the knowledge I have learned, so many times I need to repeatedly inquire them. However, in order to overcome this weakness, I recently set up my personal blog, hoping to cultivate my knowledge summary and written expression ability while running my personal blog, so that become a knowledge exporter.</p>

<p>I hope to work as a researcher in some large technology companies such as Baidu, Tencent. That’s a very competitive environment, surrounded by highly skilled people. In this environment, I can continue to make progress and explore the most cutting-edge technology in this field.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>What are your plans for your doctoral life? (你对博士生期间生活的规划是怎么样的？)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I can be admitted, I will learn the basic knowledge of this major and think of my detailed research topic before enrollment so that I can participate in the research work of lab as soon as possible. </p>
<p>After enrollment, I will keep up with the latest developments in related research fields and read the latest high-level papers. And during the first three or four years of my doctorate, I will try to produce academic research results. I don’t expect them to be many, but I want them to be high-quality and creative.</p>
<p>And in the last year of my doctorate, I will complete my doctoral thesis in a high standard.</p>
<p>What’s more, in my spare time, I will actively participate in various activities held by the school and fully enjoy my postgraduate life.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>What’s the most challenging thing you’ve done so far, and how did you overcome it? (截止到目前做的最有挑战性的事情是什么？你是怎么克服它的？)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the most challenging thing I’ve done is the second academic research experience I mentioned in the PPT. Before the project, my programming skills were very poor and my knowledge of artificial intelligence algorithms was very basic. Since the project was undertaken by me alone, the beginning was difficult. There was a lot of things to learn, there were always bug existing in the code, the results of experiments were always unsatisfactory. But this process was not painful, on the contrary, I got a sense of pleasure and achievement from overcoming these difficulties and learning new knowledge.</p>

<li><p>What do you think is the most creative part in your research? (你认为你的研究项目中最有创造性的部分是什么？)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the most creative part in my research is that, based on the assumption that one methylation site should have similar expression values in the same class of samples and different values in different class of samples, I designed a method to abstract the methylation patterns into the structure of graphs. There is a transformation from “clinical sample as main subject and the values of its methylation sites as features” to “methylation sites as main subject and the values of it on different clinical samples as features”. I think it’s a key step so that we can use graph neural network to extract the differentially expressed methylation sites.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Why do you use SAGPooling in your work?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of this research, we designed the main idea of the study, and at the main time, I was learning how to realize the programming of GNN. There is a package of python named <code>pytorch geometric</code> which is designed specifically for graph neural networks based on pytorch.</p>
<p>There was a function named SAGPooling. I wanted to know what it did, so I read the paper of this method that was attached to the website of the package. </p>
<p>After reading, I thought, Wow, it’s exactly the method that perfectly fit our idea. </p>
<p>Fortunately this method did perform well in this research.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Is any other with you in this research?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a postdoctor with me. But because she has many other projects, I did all the major work of this project. All the programming, all the experiment. During the first half of this year, I updated her regularly on my progress, and in the second half of this year, when the project came to an end, she edited the manuscript with me.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>How do you extract the methylation sites?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is mentioned before that there are 3 successive modules in the model. We fixed the pooling rate of the first two modules as 0.5 and change that of the last module to change the number of methylation sites kept finally. Through experiments, we found that the accuracy of graph classification was the highest when the pooling rate of the third module was set as 0.5. So the number of finally kept nodes was 250. </p>
<p>And theoratically, the </p>
